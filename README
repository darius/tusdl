To build: 

Install libsdl (http://www.libsdl.org).
Install tusl (http://github.com/darius/tusl).
Then type 'make'.


To run:

There are a number of different graphics hacks in this package.
Mostly you can run them with a command line like

$ ./runtusdl '`wator.ts` load'

or slime.ts, or whatever.  There are some .sh scripts to launch some
of them, also.


Evolving art:

These are launched with turtles.sh (the new program) and evo.sh (the
old one).  turtles.c and evo.c are the underlying code.  See
README.evo for usage instructions; 'turtles' only supports a few of
the evo commands at the moment.  newturtles.c was an attempt to get
the turtles to interact with each other by conditioning their behavior
on the local concentration of color laid down by all turtles so far,
but it's not working very well and it's better to use turtles.c for
now.
